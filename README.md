## Objective (Disclaimer this README is a WIP)

My goal is to create a digital character creation sheet for DND that will use the existing DND 5th Edition API 

Users can interact with my app to easily manage, update and create character sheets before and during a game of DND.

I hope for

backup API in case that ends up not working out

Features:
