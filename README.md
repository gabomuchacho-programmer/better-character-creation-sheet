## Objective (Disclaimer this README is a WIP)

My goal is to create a digital character creation sheet for DND that will use the existing DND 5th Edition API 

Users can interact with my app to easily manage, update and create character sheets before and during a game of DND.

I will be using either or both if they supplement each other well (need more research)

backup API in case that ends up not working out
https://open5e.com/

Features:

Users can log in and see previously created characters and create new characters, manage old ones. 

I will have a Character Model, and a few generic Models for custom items, weapons etc


In our sessions sometimes there can be ambient music, but for the scale of this project and I am thinking of adding a capability to have a theme song for your character using a music API like spotify.
